##Operation of the Drake Equation Shiny App

The Drake Equation App can be launch from https://matthewtanner.shinyapps.io/shinyApp

Default values are lower bounds of those chosen by Dr. Drake for his original estimation in 1961. Any value may be changed to any valid value. Note that no value may be less than zero and no factional value may be greater than 1. The new estimate is displayed automatically with a change to any factor value.


##The Drake Equation

Dr. Frank Drake, formerly of the University of California, Santa Cruz, formulated the equation which bears his name as a means to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations capable of intragalactic communication that might be extant in the Milky Way galaxy.

##Factors

R* - The average rate of galactic star formations per year

fp - The fraction of extant stars with planetary systems

ne - Of the starts that have planetary systems, the average number of planets that can support life of some kind.

fl - Of those planets hospitable to life, the fraction that in fact do develope life

fi - Of life bearing planets, the fraction in which intellegent life emerges

fc - Of planets hosting intelligent life, the fraction that develope the means for intragalactic communication or technoloy which is detectable from intragalactic distances

L - The average lifespan of civilizations with detectable technology
